Currently, I'm the second-year master student in School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University. I'm advised by [Prof. Kewei Tu](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/). My research interests are (semantic) dependency parsing, sequence labeling and multilingual NLP. I'm working as research intern in the [Alibaba Damo Academy](damo.alibaba.com). 

Here are my [Publications](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publications/) and [CV](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/cv/).
