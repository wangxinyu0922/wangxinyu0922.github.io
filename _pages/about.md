Currently, I'm the second-year master student in School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University. I'm advised by [Prof. Kewei Tu](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/). My researches are mainly focused on (semantic) dependency parsing, sequence labeling and multilingual NLP. I'm working as research intern in the [Alibaba Damo Academy](http://damo.alibaba.com). 

Here are my [Publications](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publications/) and [CV](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/cv/).

## News:

Our paper [Structure-Level Knowledge Distillation For Multilingual Sequence Labeling](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/acl-2020-structure) was accepted to ACL 2020!
