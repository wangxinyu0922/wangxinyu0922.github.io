Currently, I'm the third-year Ph.D. student in School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University. I'm advised by [Prof. Kewei Tu](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/). My researches are mainly focused on **Structured Prediction** ([Syntactic](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/aacl-2020-second)/[Semantic](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/acl-2019-second) Dependency Parsing, [Sequence Labeling](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/emnlp-2020-ain), [NAS](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/arxiv-2020-ace) in structured prediction), [**Knowledge Distillation**](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/arxiv-2020-structural) and [**Multilingual NLP**](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/acl-2020-structure). Currently, I'm working as research intern in the [Alibaba Damo Academy](http://damo.alibaba.com) collaborating with [Yong Jiang](http://jiangyong.site). 

Here are my [Publications](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publications/) and [CV](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/cv/).
