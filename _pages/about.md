Currently, I work at Alibaba Tongyi Lab. I received my Ph.D. degree from ShanghaiTech University in 2023. I was advised by [Prof. Kewei Tu](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/). My researches are mainly focused on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, including RAG for textual LLMs and multi-modal LLMs. Before I received my Ph.D., my researches are mainly focused on **Structured Prediction** ([Syntactic](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/aacl-2020-second)/[Semantic](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/acl-2019-second) Dependency Parsing, [Sequence Labeling](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/emnlp-2020-ain) (such as [Named Entity Recognition](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/acl-2021-retrieval)), [Neural Architecture Search](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/acl-2021-ace) in structured prediction), [**Knowledge Distillation**](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/acl-2021-structural) and [**Multilingual NLP**](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/acl-2020-structure). I visited [Prof. Lu Wei](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei)'s lab as a visiting research fellow at [SUTD](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/). <!-- Previously, I was interning at the Alibaba Damo Academy and collaborating with [Yong Jiang](http://jiangyong.site). Before I'm visiting [Prof. Lu Wei](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei)'s lab as a visiting research fellow at [SUTD](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/). -->

Here are my [Publications](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publications/) and [CV](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/cv/).

I am currently **hiring** self-motivated researchers and interns in Hangzhou. Please feel free to contact me with your resume. [tomas.wxy\@alibaba-inc.com](mailto:tomas.wxy@alibaba-inc.com?subject=Test)
