Projects
======
* [Cross-Framework Meaning Representation Parsing](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/conll-2019-shanghaitech) (CoNLL 2019 shared task)
  * Developed a graph-based semantic parser for five frameworks.
  * Our parser achieves the 1st place and 2nd place on in-framework metrics for DM and PSD frameworks respectively, and the 3rd place on cross-framework metrics for DM framework.
  * The paper has been accepted in the conference of CoNLL 2019.
* [Second-Order Semantic Dependency Parsing](https://wangxinyu0922.github.io/publication/acl-2019-second)
  * Developed a way to take interactions between pairs of edges in consideration in the decoding process for semantic dependency parsing and train our network in an end-to-end manner. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.
  * The paper has been accepted in the conference of ACL 2019.
* Image Captioning With Scene Graph Information
  * Developed an image caption model with scene graph information to improve the performance.
